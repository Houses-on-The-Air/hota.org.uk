                <li>Announce your call sign and your intention to call CQ, for example: "Is this frequency in use? This is [Your Call Sign]."</li>
                <li>If the frequency is clear, call CQ: "CQ CQ CQ, this is [Your Call Sign] calling CQ for Houses on The Air. CQ CQ CQ, this is [Your Call Sign] calling CQ and standing by."</li>
                <li>Listen for a response. If you hear a reply, acknowledge it and proceed with the contact.</li>
