    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>The idea for Houses on The Air (HOTA) was inspired by the success of the Summits on The Air (SOTA) programme, which encourages amateur radio operators to activate mountain summits for radio communication. HOTA was created to provide a similar experience for operators who prefer to operate from houses and other fixed locations.</p>
    <p>Since its inception, HOTA has grown in popularity and has attracted a dedicated community of operators who enjoy the challenge of activating unique house locations and making contacts with other operators. HOTA has also inspired the development of awards and contests to recognise the achievements of participants and to promote friendly competition among operators.</p>

    <h3>Launch</h3>
    <p>Houses on The Air (HOTA) was officially launched in 2025 by a group of amateur radio operators who saw the potential for a new activity that would promote fixed operations and encourage operators to explore new locations. The founders of HOTA envisioned a programme that would be accessible to operators of all skill levels and that would provide a fun and rewarding experience for participants.</p>

    <h3>Future</h3>
    <p>The future of Houses on The Air (HOTA) looks bright, with plans to expand the programme to include new activities, awards, and events. The HOTA community is growing rapidly, with operators from around the world joining in the fun and excitement of activating unique house locations and making contacts with other operators.</p>
