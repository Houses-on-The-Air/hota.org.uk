    <h1>Band Plans</h1>
    <p>Last updated: <?= date('F j, Y'); ?></p>
    <p>Band plans are a set of guidelines for using the radio spectrum within a particular frequency band. They are created by national amateur radio societies and are designed to ensure that all users of the band have an opportunity to use it without causing interference to other users.</p>
    <p>Band plans are not legally binding, but they are widely followed by amateur radio operators around the world. They are designed to promote good operating practices and to ensure that the radio spectrum is used efficiently.</p>

    <h2>UK Band Plans</h2>
    <p>The UK band plans are created by the Radio Society of Great Britain (RSGB) and are widely followed by UK amateur radio operators. They are designed to ensure that all users of the band have an opportunity to use it without causing interference to other users.</p>
    <p>The UK band plans are divided into several sections, each covering a different frequency band. The sections are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>LF (Low Frequency) Band</li>
        <li>MF (Medium Frequency) Band</li>
        <li>HF (High Frequency) Band</li>
        <li>VHF (Very High Frequency) Band</li>
        <li>UHF (Ultra High Frequency) Band</li>
        <li>SHF (Super High Frequency) Band</li>
        <li>EHF (Extremely High Frequency) Band</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The UK band plans are available on the RSGB website and are regularly updated to reflect changes in operating practices and technology.</p>

    <h2>International Band Plans</h2>
    <p>International band plans are created by the International Amateur Radio Union (IARU) and are designed to ensure that amateur radio operators around the world can use the radio spectrum without causing interference to each other.</p>
    <p>The international band plans are divided into several sections, each covering a different frequency band. The sections are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>LF (Low Frequency) Band</li>
        <li>MF (Medium Frequency) Band</li>
        <li>HF (High Frequency) Band</li>
        <li>VHF (Very High Frequency) Band</li>
        <li>UHF (Ultra High Frequency) Band</li>
        <li>SHF (Super High Frequency) Band</li>
        <li>EHF (Extremely High Frequency) Band</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The international band plans are available on the IARU website and are regularly updated to reflect changes in operating practices and technology.</p>

    <h2>Band Plan Resources</h2>
    <p>There are several resources available to help amateur radio operators understand and use the band plans. These include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Band plan charts, which show the frequency allocations for each band</li>
        <li>Band plan guides, which explain the operating practices and guidelines for each band</li>
        <li>Band plan software, which can help amateur radio operators track their frequency usage and avoid interference with other users</li>
    </ul>
