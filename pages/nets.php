    <h3>What is a net?</h3>
    <p>A "net" in amateur radio, also called a "ham net," refers to an organised gathering of amateur radio operators on a specific frequency at a set time, where they communicate with each other for a particular purpose, like relaying messages, discussing a common topic, or coordinating emergency response during severe weather events; essentially, it's an "on-the-air" network of ham radio operators with a specific goal.</p>

    <h3>When is the net?</h3>
    <p>The HOTA net is held every day at 20:00 UTC.</p>

    <h3>Where is the net?</h3>
    <p>We operate 3 sepeate nets here at HOTA to allow for the most operators to join.<p>
