            <p>At Houses on The Air, we believe in the power of open collaboration and transparency.
               That's why we've embraced open source principles throughout our organization. We're committed
               to sharing our code, encouraging community contributions, and building on the foundation
               laid by other open source projects.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Understanding Open Source</h3>
    <p>Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance. By using and contributing to open source software, we can foster a collaborative community and drive innovation.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Benefits of Open Source</h3>
    <p>Using open source software for HOTA offers numerous benefits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Anyone can review the code, ensuring security and reliability.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Developers from around the world can contribute, improving the software.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost-effective:</strong> Open source software is often free to use, reducing costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> The software can be customised to meet specific needs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 3: Publishing HOTA Software as Open Source</h3>
    <p>We are committed to publishing all software developed for HOTA as open source. This allows the community to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Review and improve the code through peer review</li>
        <li>Create new features and fix bugs to benefit everyone</li>
        <li>Adapt the software for other amateur radio events and purposes</li>
        <li>Share knowledge and best practices across the radio community</li>
        <li>Build upon each other's work rather than reinventing the wheel</li>
    </ul>
